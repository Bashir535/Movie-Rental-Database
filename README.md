# Movie-Rental-Database
This is a full stack Movie Rental System built using Java, Spring Boot, JDBC/JPA, and MySQL, following a clean three tier architecture. The system supports user accounts, movie inventory management, rental processing, and review submissions with admin level features for managing all data.

For the Front End we used:
React
Tailwind CSS
Redux
Axios

For the Back End we used:
Spring Boot(Java)
JDBC + MySQL

For our Database we used MySQL with schema and some build tools we used include maven and npm.

The dependencies used in this project include:

Front End(package.json)
axios
react
react-dom
react-router-dom
react-redux
tailwind CSS
vite

Backend(pom.xml):
spring-boot-starter-webmvc
spring-boot-starter-jdbc
mysql-connector-j
lombok

To run this project you must make sure your database, frontend, and backend are all running correctly.

To set up the database you want to open up MySQL Workbench and create a new schema named moviedb.
Then run the SQL Schema.

To set up the backend :
Install Java 17 or higher as well as Maven
Then you can run the backend through terminal.

To set up the front end:
Install the dependencies from terminal and start the dev server.
Once you've set those 3 components up correctly you should be able to run the program smoothly.
